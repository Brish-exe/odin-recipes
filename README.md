# odin-recipes

This is for Project: Recipes from TOP.  

This project allowed me to create a basic set of web pages that provide descriptions, instructions, and steps to make select recipes.  These sites are referenced in the index.html located in the odin-recipes repository. Recipe contents are meant to be satirical and not replicated in real life.  I am not responsible for the mess in your kitchen if you followed the Chili recipe :).
